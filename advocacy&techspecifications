Since founding FabRiders we have helped a number of organisations plan and implement tech projects that range from improving websites, implementing data projects to creating graphics and visualisations. 

Here's what we learned:
    
To Prepare: 
    
1. Have a vision of success for the project. You need to understand how the project contributes to the overall change you are seeking.  How does this support your Theory of Change? Where does it fit within the organisational strategy? 

2. Understand how this will engage your audience. What value will your user actually find when using the output of your project? You will likely need to spend the greatest amount of time and effort in this area. Identify the types of users you will have and then actually identify real people that exemplify those types. Create user profiles that provide biographical details along with user stories that will describe the activities users will be doing with your outputs.

But don't rely on your own awareness of your users. Remember that you are building a 'user experience' and we stress understanding your user inside and out, be aware of the experience you will provide them. Interview and survey your users to find out why they would want to use your project. Specifically you will want to learn:

What their organisation is trying to accomplish and what their role is in supporting that.
How does your project support what they are working on.
When would they use your project? get specifics, what will they do with the information they are getting from your project? Who will they show it to? What are they hoping to accomplish?
What sort of technology do they have access to? What device would they use for access? What browser do they use? What will the speed of their internet  connection be? Will they be wanting to download your information? In what formats?

In particular, know when they will come to your site and what they will want to do with the information they are accessing. Have you made it as easy as possible for them to do this?

3. Identify an internal project manager that will be responsible for the overall process. you will need to maintain ownership of the project internally. Never outsource responsibility.

Finding external expertise:
    
As part of a formal process to identify a developer or consultant 'request for proposal' or RFP that contains your brief/specification requirements. This should illuminate your expectations as much as possible. It will need to include: 
    
- What your organisation does and what it is trying to achieve 

- How this project fits into the overall vision of success for the organisation

- Your goals and objectives for this project.  

- User profiles - Demographics, their contexts and what they will get out of the project outputs

- User stories - what they are doing when they engage with the solution.

- Information Archeticture - this might include wireframes that show how the navigation and interface might look.

- Coexistance - will this be fitting into your organisaitonal digital ecosystem? How?

- Look and feel
    
- Technology and requirements:
    Browser and device support (though this has become more di riguer of late, it's still important to articulate, particularly if you have identified key browsers and devices in your user research).
    Formats - do you need to provide PDF's for people that will want to print out information? Will you need a data visualisation? Will you need to provide a spreadsheet for those that will want to interact with the data on their own?
    Security requirements 
    - are you collecting data? How will you protect it? 
- How will you protect the people that will access your website and assure their activity can't be tracked?
Accessibility requirements
Low Bandwidth requirements
Required/preferred programming/stacks/crms (e.g, Wordpress, Drupal, Python, Rails, PHP, etc)

- License requirements
We can not stress how critical it is to use free and open source licensing, along with Creative Commons for your content. Make sure your potential consultant has the same values and priorities.

- Hosting Requirements

- Long term maintenance

- Your timeline

- What are other project milestones that are reliant on the finalisation of the project? What are other deadlines that will be impacted by delays in this project?

- What user testing will need to occur before launch? Who should be involved in the testing? What questions will you ask testers to 

- Non functional requirements

- Budget

- Profile of preffered design/development firm

Should they be proficient in a particular programming language (one that fits into your current set up?).
Stress that you will only work with people that are attentive to detail
