Checklist for a Tech Specification that will support social change efforts

The purpose of this article is to help people working on social change efforts to understand what they need to know before undertaking a technology project and how to communicate that to internal technology related staff or a potential external developer/consultant hire. This document was created with the input of several colleagues and was also greatly informed by [Aspirationâ€™s Request for Proposal (RFP) Template](https://aspirationtech.org/training/workflow/templates/rfp).

FabRiders has helped dozens of advocacy and rights organisations plan and implement tech projects that range from improving websites, implementing data projects, to creating graphics and visualisations. Most individuals that are involved in creating social change have very different processes than those that are focused on creating technologies (though these two communities are merging more than ever these days). This can also mean that social change organisations have a clear idea of _what_ they would like to create using tech, but are fuzzy on _how_ to get there:

- What information does a techie or developer need from me in order to get their job done?
- What can I expect from a tech service provider? What shouldn't I expect?
- How can I make sure that my vision for the impact of the final product is the same as the service provider's vision?

## Preparation

Develop a vision of success for the project. Understand how the project contributes to the overall change you are seeking to create. How does this support your Theory of Change? Where does it fit within the organisational strategy?

Understand how this will engage your audience. What value will your user actually find when using the output of your project? You will likely need to spend the greatest amount of time and effort in this area. [See this post on creating user profiles and user stories.](http://www.fabriders.net/hacking-user-centred-design/)

Identify who in your own organisation should oversee the project. You may need to assign a team, depending on how it will be integrated into your work, but make sure you have one person who is assigned responsibility to make sure everything will run ontime and within budget  

##  Creating the specification document

A specification document will act as the anchor for your tech project.  It will be critical for clearly articulating your needs to a developer or consultant so that they can give you an estimate of time and budget.  You should include it as part of a formal process to identify a developer or consultant in a  'request for proposal' call. This should illuminate your expectations as much as possible. It will need to include:

- What your organisation does and what it is trying to achieve

- How this project fits into the overall vision of success for the organisation

- Your goals and objectives for this project. What is the impact you are expecting this project to have? How will it engage stakeholders?

- Information about your users
-- User profiles - Demographics, their contexts and what value they will get out of the project outputs
-- User stories - what they are doing when they engage with the solution.

- Navigation and Information Archeticture - this might include wireframes that show how the navigation and interface might look. (see this link for how to create wire frames).

- Look and feel - what sort of response do you want people to have when they see it? Should it's look be dictated by organisational or project branding?  

- Technology requirements: 
-- Browser and device support (though this has become more diriguer of late, it's still important to articulate, particularly if you have identified key browsers and devices in your user research). 
-- Formats - do you need to provide PDF's for people that will want to print out information? Will you need a data visualisation? Will you need to provide a spreadsheet for those that will want to interact with the data on their own? 
-- Coexistence - will this be fitting into your organisaitonal digital ecosystem? How? What are the requirements based on that. 
-- Security requirements are you collecting data? How will you protect it? How will you protect the people that will access your website and assure their activity can't be tracked? 
-- Accessibility requirements 
-- Low Bandwidth requirements 
-- Required/preferred programming/stacks/crms (e.g, Wordpress, Drupal, Python, Rails, PHP, etc) 
-- Hosting Requirements

- License requirements. We can not stress how critical it is to use free and open source licensing, along with Creative Commons for your content. Make sure your potential consultant has the same values and priorities.

- Long term maintenance and development. How wil it be maintained and further developed after launch?

- Timeline. What are other project milestones that are reliant on the finalisation of the project? What are other deadlines that will be impacted by delays in this project? What user testing will need to occur before launch? Who should be involved in the testing? What questions will you ask testers to

- Non functional requirements

- Your Budget

- Profile of preffered design/development firm. Should they be proficient in a particular programming language (one that fits into your current set up?). 

## Once you have identified a consultant or developer
They will likely want to create a functional/requirement analysis, the process will likely include conducting a needs analysis. (This needs better explaination)
